                <p class="s-subheading">👋🏼 Hi! I'm Becky Tarnowski, and I am an 
                    educator turned software engineer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As an educator, I know how important it is for kids to see 
                    themselves represented in books, but there is a disparity 
                    around who is represented. I created Everykid to allow 
                    people to easily find books that celebrate diversity.

                    <br>
                <p class="tagline">Because every kid deserves to see themselves 
                in a book.</p>
